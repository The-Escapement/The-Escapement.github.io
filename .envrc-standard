# This is a recommended standard Direnv .envrc for this repository.
#
# Assuming you have Nix and Direnv set up, at the project root:
#
#     echo 'source .envrc-standard' > .envrc
#     direnv allow
#
# This allows you to put in your own custom environment variable setting for the
# project without affecting what's checked in.
